# NTSLF_code
(Some) code for the NTSLF website

The idea is that this would be a good place to keep code for the autogeneration of NTSLF plots.

At present (Jul'23) there are two scripts:
surge_anim.py
* map animations of sealevel and surge

surge_ens.py
* station by station time series plots of 7-day surge forecast using the meteorological forcing ensemble.
  (This is experimental)
