# NTSLF_code
(Some) code for the NTSLF website

The idea is that this would be a good place to keep code for the autogeneration of NTSLF plots.

At present (Jul'23) there are two scripts:

**Animations of sea level and surge**

surge_anim.py

![surge_anom_latest_0001](https://github.com/NOC-MSM/NTSLF_code/assets/22616872/80582568-d33e-4deb-b4a7-15cd1ef1f1e6)

---

**Time series plots of 7-day surge forecast using the meteorological forcing ensemble.**

surge_ens.py

  (This is experimental)
